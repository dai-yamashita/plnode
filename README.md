## Evented I/O stuffed straight up Postgres' sweet PL.

This is merely an edge effort.  An effort to add yet another edge to the rapid evolution of web-oriented frameworks.

Currently this is extremely alpha, it is based on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [PLV8](https://code.google.com/p/plv8js/wiki/PLV8) drawing heavily from both and attempting to change as little as possible while still achieving the goal.
